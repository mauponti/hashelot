![Hash me like one of your french blocks.](/images/hashelot_wbg.png)

Hashelot, born under the lockdown, is something you kids might call a *startup*, an experimental venture across smart contracts and dApp development.

At first it will be an Ethereum-centric project, but from that point on it may leap to other crypto ecosystems depending on the initial outcome or the appeal those crypto-systems play.
