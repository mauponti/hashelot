      <description>Imagine you are a superhero who is fighting against an invisible crime organization that operates all across the world.
As all superheroes do, you need to hide your identity, but the good news is you&amp;rsquo;re not alone in this fight. You can count on a league of superhero friends to detect and control new crimes.
Each one of you has a secret identity. Even better, your secret identities can change every 10 minutes.</description>

      <description>Flashloans are zero-risk instruments in the universe of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Their purpose is not much different from the one held by more traditional loans: borrowing money to invest it in ventures or personal projects and lending it in order to gain a profit.
As the name itself suggests though, the novelty of the decentralized version lies in its instantaneous lifespan, a quality that on one hand enormously limits what a borrower can do with the received money, but that on the other hand manages to cancel credit risk, the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower&amp;rsquo;s failure to repay a loan, making theoretically possible to lend any amount of money (Ether or tokens) to anyone without any risk.</description>
