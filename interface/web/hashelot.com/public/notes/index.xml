        <description>Playing around and coding with Solidity forces developers to adapt their way of thinking, especially if they come from more traditional languages.
The initial hype many feel when learning for the first time about distributed ledger technologies is then usually weakened by the hard truth that blockchains are often oversold as a universal remedy to unfairness in the financial system, that is unless a maximalist stance is held despite solid criticism, and by the fact that a harder to hack structure comes with the property of having harder to implement features.</description>

        <description>While working on the web interface for my first smart contract, Rings, I had a chance to experience, unfortunately more than once, the message of doom that is a failed transaction due to the contract execution running out of gas.
The allocation of gas for a certain transaction is an unavoidable element in the working principles of the Ethereum blockchain and from a game theoretic point of view such is the concept of an economic compensation for the time or resources spent to keep a distributed structure active and with an acceptable level of security, in any general blockchain setting.</description>

        <description>You know those projects you keep postponing as you wait for the right moment to tackle them, but then a global pandemic hits the whole planet and you are faced with the choice of dedicating your newly acquired spare time doing chores around the house or pretending you are studying for an important project you had been postponing (waiting for the right time to develop it) and you choose wisely?</description>
