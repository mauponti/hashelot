        <description>This is hardly a note, since it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than an announcement: you can now use Dapper ETH to play Rings.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you will be able to keep using MetaMask as well to have fun or operate decentralized applications on Hashelot, but since Dapper let&amp;rsquo;s you have 3 free transactions per week1, it sounded like an interesting addition to this website features.
Being able to use Dapper will help those willing to enter low stack rounds of Rings save up on gas fees and possibly finalize closed rounds without the need for additional spending.</description>

        <title>Trading assets in the lifespan of a single block (and hopefully profiting from it)</title>

        <description>Flashloans are zero-risk instruments in the universe of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Their purpose is not much different from the one held by more traditional loans: borrowing money to invest it in ventures or personal projects and lending it in order to gain a profit.
As the name itself suggests though, the novelty of the decentralized version lies in its instantaneous lifespan, a quality that on one hand enormously limits what a borrower can do with the received money, but that on the other hand manages to cancel credit risk, the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower&amp;rsquo;s failure to repay a loan, making theoretically possible to lend any amount of money (Ether or tokens) to anyone without any risk.</description>

        <description>Playing around and coding with Solidity forces developers to adapt their way of thinking, especially if they come from more traditional languages.
The initial hype many feel when learning for the first time about distributed ledger technologies is then usually weakened by the hard truth that blockchains are often oversold as a universal remedy to unfairness in the financial system, that is unless a maximalist stance is held despite solid criticism, and by the fact that a harder to hack structure comes with the property of having harder to implement features.</description>

        <title>How I learned to stop worrying and love pending transactions</title>

        <description>While working on the web interface for my first smart contract, Rings, I had a chance to experience, unfortunately more than once, the message of doom that is a failed transaction due to the contract execution running out of gas.
The allocation of gas for a certain transaction is an unavoidable element in the working principles of the Ethereum blockchain and from a game theoretic point of view such is the concept of an economic compensation for the time or resources spent to keep a distributed structure active and with an acceptable level of security, in any general blockchain setting.</description>

        <description>You know those projects you keep postponing as you wait for the right moment to tackle them, but then a global pandemic hits the whole planet and you are faced with the choice of dedicating your newly acquired spare time doing chores around the house or pretending you are studying for an important project you had been postponing (waiting for the right time to develop it) and you choose wisely?</description>
