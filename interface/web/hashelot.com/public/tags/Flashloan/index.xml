        <description>Flashloans are zero-risk instruments in the universe of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Their purpose is not much different from the one held by more traditional loans: borrowing money to invest it in ventures or personal projects and lending it in order to gain a profit.
As the name itself suggests though, the novelty of the decentralized version lies in its instantaneous lifespan, a quality that on one hand enormously limits what a borrower can do with the received money, but that on the other hand manages to cancel credit risk, the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower&amp;rsquo;s failure to repay a loan, making theoretically possible to lend any amount of money (Ether or tokens) to anyone without any risk.</description>
